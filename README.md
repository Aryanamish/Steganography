# Steganography
Steganography is the practice of hiding information within other, seemingly innocent media. This can include hiding a message within an image, audio file, or even other text. The goal of steganography is to conceal the existence of the message, rather than encrypting it, making it more difficult to detect. Steganography is often used to protect sensitive information, such as communication between espionage agents, but it can also be used for illegal activities like hiding malware within seemingly innocent files.
This repository contains a basic implementation of the idea of steganography. You can view it [here](https://aryanamish.github.io/steganography/).
